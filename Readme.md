----------

### Purpose
***Courts*** is a simple to use booking application designed for a local tennis court business. It was developed to replace their previous system that relied on phone bookings and cash envelopes.

##### Client Requirements

- Simple & easy to use UI 
- online payments
- Ability for coaches to advertise lessons on a member noticeboard
- Ability for Admin users to: 
  - post events on a member noticeboard
  - create, edit and delete any bookings

### Functionality / Features
There are 3 types of user accounts: *Player*, *Coach* and *Admin*. 

Users must create a profile first before a booking can be made and have the option of uploading a profile picture.

Players can book a court for an allotted time and hire additional tennis gear at checkout. Coaches can do the same as players with the added ability to advertise their coaching services on the member noticeboard.

Admins can create, edit and delete any booking or any post on the virtual noticeboard. 

The homepage for the Player and Coach comprises a tennis court graphic that shows the current and next availability of each court. The Admin has an additional calendar interface to see bookings across days and weeks, as well as events.

### Target audience
The target audience are the players and coaches that use the tennis court and the admin staff who run the court.

### Tech stack (explain what each part of the tech stack is doing)

##### [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) 
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be run on the server. 

##### [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)

ExpressJS is a web framework that runs on top of NodeJS and will be used to handle HTTP requests, middleware and routing.

##### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) / [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) / [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

Our database will be created using *MongoDB*, a NoSQL, non-relational database system. The most important advantage for us is the ability to store any file type in a document model and will allow us to store files that are uploaded to our site by different users. The major use case will be user profile display pictures.

*Mongo Atlas* allows us to store our data in the cloud and connect it to our application.

*Mongoose* is an object modelling solution that is used to interface with and create the schema for the Mongo database.

##### [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

ReactJS will be used to create the interactive UI. The interface components will automatically update to reflect data changes such as bookings made and court availability.

##### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 

Netlify will host the ReactJS frontend code and assist with testing from the development to the production stage.

##### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

Heroku will host the backend code and handle traffic, resources, management and device compatibility.

##### [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)

For user authentication purposes, we will be using Passport - a NodeJS middleware which plays well with ExpressJS and provides a number of different 'strategies' for authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We will implement JWT method for the initial MVP and will consider implementing the OAuth 2.0 strategy as an additonal feature.

##### [Stripe](https://stripe.com/au)

Stripe will be used to handle payments and refunds for the application. It is easy to use, setup and customise for our application and user experience.

##### [ToastUI Calendar](https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar)

ToastUI is a JavaScript user interface library. We will be specifically using the Calendar features for the admin user to keep track of all events and bookings. Multiple features of the application will require access to the calendar or its data to keep information up to date and in sync. The main benefit of choosing this particular library is that it is open source and versatile enough for our use case. Other options we considered provided the necessary features but required a paid subscription which wasn't an option for us.

##### [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)

Multer is a middleware that will manage form data and handle the storage of uploaded files in our database.

### Context / Dataflow Diagrams

### Wireframes

The home page for the wireframes is potentially the most key to the application.  This is because a huge focus of the app (client requirement) is to improve the customer experience of interacting with the business.  With this we have tried to design the home screen to deliver the most important information to the customer as effectively as possible (Court availability).

![Phone-Home-Screen](docs/Phone/MERN-Home-Whim.PNG)

Some additional features to the application include account types.  For example admin accounts will have access to a userlist to quickly find individuals and their profiles.  All user accounts will be player accounts by default so admins neede permission to edit user accounts when coaches have been verified.  Below are some admin account screens.

Userlist            |  Profile | Edit Profile

In terms of responsiveness outside some margin and spacing changes there won't bee anything too major changing with design.  The biggest changes will be the home page for Tablet and Desktop, making use of the larger screen size to introduce a graphic for court availability and a navigation bar on desktop to utilise screen width.

### Trello

We opted for a kanban board template and set 3 coloured labels indicating priority (low, med, critical) and 2 coloured labels indicating whether the card is associated with the backend or the frontend. When a card is in the 'To-Do' or 'Doing' list, it is given a due date and ticked off when completed. When working on a card, the dev assigns themselves to it so that division of work is clear.
